Django Web Development notes by j0azz

[+] Create a new Django project
    django-admin startproject PROJECT

Django comes, by default, with SQLite support. 

[+] Run database migrations on PROJECT
    python manage.py migrate

[+] Start the development server
    python manage.py runserver

Once we have created a project, we need to create it's applications. 
Django comes with default applications, allowed in INSTALLED_APPS, on settings.py. 
Some of these applications:
    django.contrib.admin
    django.contrib.auth
    django.contrib.contenttypes
    django.contrib.sessions

[+] Create a Django Application inside PROJECT
    python manage.py startapp APP

[+] Activating a Django application
After creating the models of an application, we need to make some changes at settings.py.
Add the application name (APP in this example) in the variable INSTALLED_APPS;
after it, run the following command:
    python manage.py makemigrations APP

[+] Django ORM (object-relational mapper) 
Compatible with MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, Oracle, PostgreSQL
MODEL.objects is the default manager for all MODELs.
    
    MODEL.objects.get(...)

    model = MODEL(...)
    model.save() 
    # or, simply:   
    #   model = MODEL(...).save()
    # or
    #   MODEL.objects.create(...)

    MODEL.objects.filter(...)
    # if you want to exclude some results, just do:
    #   MODEL.objects.filter(...).exclude(...)

    MODEL.objects.order_by(...)

    model = MODEL.objects.get()
    model.delete()

[+] Django Templates
    {% tag %}

    {{ variable }}

    {{ variable|filter }}
